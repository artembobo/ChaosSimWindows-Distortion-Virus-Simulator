# ChaosSimWindows-Distortion-Virus-Simulator
ChaosSim is a Python-based simulated virus that mimics chaotic malware behavior without harming the system. Designed for educational or prank use, it uses Tkinter for the GUI and modules like pyautogui, psutil, winsound, and subprocess to create a realistic "infected system" experience.
